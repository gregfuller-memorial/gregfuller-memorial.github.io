	<p align="justify"><b>Greg</b> was born in Palo Alto, California, grew up in Ann Arbor, and spent his entire adult life at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, a city he loved.</p>
	
	<p align="justify">Greg received his bachelor's degree in molecular biology at Johns Hopkins in 2015. In 2016 he joined the doctoral program in Cell, Molecular, Developmental Biology, and Biophysics at Hopkins, conducting basic research on metabolism in the lab of Professor John Kim. Dr. Kim described his most recent work as a "tour de force in in vitro biochemistry." Dr. Kim and his lab are collectively putting together the substantial body of Greg's research publications and unpublished manuscripts. His Ph.D. degree will be conferred posthumously.</p>
	<p align="justify">Greg was a kind, sweet, loving, patient, brilliant young man who loved his fiancée, his family, and his colleagues. He was an avid reader of history, philosophy, and literature. He was passionate about music, art, science, and his scientific research. He embraced Baltimore culture and balanced his life with cooking and long distance running. He was currently re-listening to one of his favorite podcasts, 'This American Life,' and had worked his way back to the early 2000s.</p>
	
	<p align="justify">He loved life. He will always be in our hearts and in the hearts of all of those who loved him. </p>
